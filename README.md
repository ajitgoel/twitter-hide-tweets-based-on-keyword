## ✨ Features

- **🚫 Media Hiding**: Individual toggles to hide images and videos/GIFs.
- **🔍 Keyword Filtering**: Automatically hide tweets containing specific words or phrases (comma-separated).
- **🌑 Grayscale Mode**: Toggle a site-wide grayscale filter to reduce the psychological "pull" of vibrant colors and stay focused.
- **⚡ Real-time Updates**: Settings apply dynamically as you browse or scroll—no page refresh required for new content.
- **🛡️ Privacy First**: Runs entirely in your browser. Your settings and filtered keywords are saved locally using `chrome.storage.sync`.
